Beacons Mens Team is a christian based team of men whose mission is simple, give christian men a place to go get plugged in. Go to outings that range anywhere from hunting and fishing, to golf and go carts and everything in between. We will also be involved in community projects, disaster relief, self defense training, and outreach programs such as toys for tots and mentoring programs for young men in fatherless homes. Our goal is to give men a way to connect. Whether it be discipleship, accountability partners, counceling, or just want to go to the outings and enjoy time with "the guys".
